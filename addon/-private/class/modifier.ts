/**
 * A base class for modifiers which need more capabilities than function-based
 * modifiers. Useful if, for example:
 *
 * 1. You need to inject services and access them
 * 2. You need fine-grained control of updates, either for performance or
 *    convenience reasons, and don't want to teardown the state of your modifier
 *    every time only to set it up again.
 * 3. You need to store some local state within your modifier.
 *
 * The lifecycle hooks of class modifiers are tracked. When they run, they any
 * values they access will be added to the modifier, and the modifier will
 * update if any of those values change.
